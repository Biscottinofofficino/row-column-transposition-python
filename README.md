[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Get%20from%20GitHub-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Biscottinofofficino/row-column-transposition-python)

## 📖 Description

This application lets you explore the Row-Column Transposition cipher, a classical method of encryption and decryption. It is built in Python, mainly for educational purposes. It helps you understand how text can be encrypted by rearranging letters based on rows and columns, a common technique used before modern cryptography. You don't need any programming skills to use this; just follow the steps below.

## 🎯 Features

- Encrypt messages by mixing letters using the row-column method.
- Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the same method.
- Learn about column permutation in classical ciphers.
- Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.
- Simple, text-based interface for ease of use.
- No need to install any complex software or coding environment.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12 or later, Linux with Python installed.
- Python version: Python 3.6 or newer (If you don’t have Python, instructions are included).
- Free disk space: At least 10 MB.
- Internet connection: Required only for downloading the software.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can use this software without knowing programming. If you have Python installed, running this tool is straightforward. If not, don’t worry—we explain how to get everything ready.

### Step 1: Download the software

You will get all the necessary files from the GitHub page.

### Step 2: Prepare your computer

#### If you don’t have Python:

- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download and install the latest version of Python for your operating system.
- During installation, make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" (important for running commands).

#### If you already have Python installed:

- Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
- Check Python is installed by typing:  
  `python --version`  
  or  
  `python3 --version`  
- You should see a version number like 3.6 or higher.

### Step 3: Install the tool

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub page by clicking on the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder you can easily find.
3. Open your command prompt or terminal.
4. Change the folder to where you extracted the files. For example:  
   `cd Downloads/row-column-transposition-python`
5. No extra installation is needed because it is a plain Python script.

### Step 4: Running the program

- In the command prompt or terminal, type:  
  `python main.py`  
  or  
  `python3 main.py`  
- Follow the instructions shown on the screen to encrypt or decrypt messages.

## 🛠 How to Use the Program

When you run the program, the main menu allows you to pick these options:

1. **Encrypt a message**  
   - Enter the text you want to hide.  
   - Provide a keyword or number that controls the column order.  
   - The program shows the scrambled output, which is your encrypted message.

2. **Decrypt a message**  
   - Enter the encrypted text.  
   - Use the same keyword or number as you did when encrypting.  
   - The program reveals your original message.

3. **Exit the program** at any time by choosing the exit option.

### Tips for using the cipher

- Keep your keyword private if you want to keep messages secret.
- Try different keywords to see how they affect the output.
- This cipher is for learning only; it is not secure for protecting real sensitive data.

This link takes you to the main GitHub page where you can download the ZIP file with all program files. Extract and run the program as explained above.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you run into problems, try these simple fixes:

- **Python commands not recognized:**  
  Make sure Python is installed and added to your system’s PATH.

- **Program won’t start or shows errors:**  
  Double-check you are in the correct folder where you extracted the files.  
  Use exact commands: `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`.

- **Text input problems:**  
  Type only letters and spaces. Avoid special characters unless you want to explore.

If issues persist, you may search for help online using keywords like "Python run script" or "Python command not found."
